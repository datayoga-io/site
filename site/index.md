benefit-minimize-risk:
  heading: Minimize Risk
  text: Minimize the risks associated with manual conversions. A built-in validation process is automatically created for each transformation, checking the integrity and consistency of data, ensuring any potential issues are identified and resolved early. Our preliminary assessments detect potential obstacles before the migration begins, allowing for timely and effective planning. This proactive approach not only maintains the quality and reliability of your data infrastructure but also minimizes downtime and operational disruptions.

  steps:
    - bullet: 1.
      title: Assessment
      subtitle1: Comprehensive analysis for informed migration
      text: Our assessment process identifies all data sources, data targets, lookup entities, transformations, and expression types, producing a detailed report that classifies the complexity of each pipeline.
    - bullet: 2.
      title: Conversion
      subtitle1: Parse and process pipelines
      text: Rewire passive transformations into a streamlined, linear flow and transform all blocks into our proprietary, target-agnostic format. This ensures that piplines are ready to be optimized for any cloud environment in the subsequent rendering step.
    - bullet: 3.
      title: Rendering
      subtitle1: Generate artifacts in specific dialect
      text: Artifacts are generated tailored to specific cloud targets, ensuring accurate dialect translation and optimization. This process meticulously adapts your pipelines to the unique requirements and capabilities of your chosen cloud platform.
    - bullet: 4.
      title: Validation
      subtitle1: Ensuring data consistency
      text: During this stage, all rendered artifacts are verified to function correctly and that data entities align precisely with those in the target database. Using automated comparison tools, the new pipelines are regression tested to ensure a full match with the legacy system.
    - bullet: 5.
      title: Acceptance
      subtitle1: End-to-end regression testing
      text: Rendered artifacts are executed in the cloud platform. A detailed comparison is conducted of the target data entities with those from the legacy pipelines. This final verification ensures that the migration not only aligns perfectly with operational requirements but also maintains data integrity.
