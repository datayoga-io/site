# Migration Process Section
migration-process:
  heading: "The Migration Process with DataYoga"
  steps:
    - bullet: 1.
      title: Assessment
      subtitle1: Comprehensive analysis for informed migration
      text: Our assessment process identifies all data sources, data targets, lookup entities, transformations, and expression types, producing a detailed report that classifies the complexity of each pipeline and its suitability for Snowflake's architecture..
    - bullet: 2.
      title: Conversion
      subtitle1: Parse and process pipelines
      text: Rewire passive transformations into a streamlined, linear flow and transform all blocks into our proprietary, target-agnostic format. This ensures that pipelines are ready to be optimized for Snowflake's cloud environment in the subsequent rendering step.
    - bullet: 3.
      title: Rendering and Optimization
      subtitle1: Generate Snowflake-optimized SQL

      text: Snowflake-compatible SQL queries are generated, leveraging Snowflake's unique features. Our process ensures accurate dialect translation and optimization for Snowflake's architecture..
    - bullet: 4.
      title: Validation
      subtitle1: Ensuring data consistency
      text: During this stage, all rendered artifacts are verified to function correctly and that data entities align precisely with those in the Snowflake environment. Using automated comparison tools, the new pipelines are regression tested to ensure a full match with the legacy system.
    - bullet: 5.
      title: Acceptance
      subtitle1: End-to-end regression testing
      text: Rendered artifacts are executed in the Snowflake platform. A detailed comparison is conducted of the target data entities with those from the legacy pipelines. This final verification ensures that the migration not only aligns perfectly with operational requirements but also maintains data integrity.
